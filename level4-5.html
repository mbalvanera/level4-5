        <p><h1>
        The essence of<br> your being is here<br> to stay</h1>
        </p>
        <p><h2>
as it infuses with my skin and heart and eyes and touch
    </h2></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>my skin</li> <li>has been tattooed through your caress</li>
                <li>and my heart has been</li> <li>mended by the way your</li> 
                <li>eyes peer into my soul you fill me with love and </li><li>make me whole</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h3><em>
in retrospect i truly<br> thought i knew what love was<br>
but this was all a lie until i had met you<br>
masochistic obsession is all i was familiar with
blinking the past away<br>
i am aware of you and our future and our present<br>
            and how i will never let that get away<br></em></h3>
        </p>
        <p>
        I never knew you could know<br> me so much better<br>
I ignored all the great weather<br> 
            the darkest cloud hung over me and<br><h1> I</h1> let my head fall on the air<br>
my hair was still wet but not the day<br> that we met
        </p>
        <p>
Was it someone like you who did it<br> to be so kind<br>
            Leaves on the grass with words drawn<br><h1> out</h1>
You admired me and wanted to hold my<br> hand
I let the curtains fly in<br>
Didn’t want the wind to pass me by<br>
        </p>
        <p>
Wearing the t-shirts with the cheesiest slogans<br>
Dropping love on my sleeve<br>
Too many wishes that I hope they’re not an omen<br>
            I never knew a heart could beat for<br> <h1>me</h1>
        </p>
